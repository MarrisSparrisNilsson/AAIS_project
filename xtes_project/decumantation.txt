🎯 CURRENT STATUS - Where You Are
✅ WHAT WORKS PERFECTLY:
Docker Infrastructure ✅

Containers build successfully

MLFlow and API services start

Networking between containers works

MLFlow Model Registry ✅

Models are being trained and registered (you're on version 5!)

Experiment tracking works

MLFlow UI is accessible at http://localhost:5000

FastAPI Service ✅

API starts successfully

Endpoints are accessible

Can receive requests

Train model → 2. Register in MLFlow → 3. Serve via API → 4. Make predictions

🔄 The Complete MLOps Workflow - Why Each Component
1. MLflow - The Laboratory
Why: Track, compare, and manage your model development
When: During model development phase
What it does:

text
Input: Your training code
Output: Tracked experiments + Packaged models
2. FastAPI - The Store Front
Why: Serve predictions to users via HTTP API
When: After you have a trained model
What it does:

text
Input: HTTP requests with data
Output: Predictions as HTTP responses
3. Docker - The Shipping Container
Why: Make your app run anywhere consistently
When: When you're ready to deploy
What it does:

text
Input: Your code + dependencies
Output: Portable container that runs everywhere
📋 Simple Step-by-Step Workflow:
Phase 1: Development (Your Laptop)
text
[You writing code] 
    → [MLflow: Track experiments] 
    → [Choose best model] 
    → [Register in MLflow]
Phase 2: Serving (Still Your Laptop)
text
[MLflow Model Registry] 
    → [FastAPI: Load model] 
    → [Serve predictions]
Phase 3: Deployment (Others' Machines)
text
[FastAPI + Model] 
    → [Docker: Package everything] 
    → [Others run your container]
